# Welcome to PS2 Classics Vault #

Welcome if you are here for ps2classicsvault.com then you are in the right place.

We created this github repository to give everyone the ability to keep using our services even after the death of the our website.

Below we will provide instructions on how to setup PKGi if you wish to add it to your existing PKGi app, if you want to go the easier way you can download our official PS2CV Store for PS3 that includes our full libary of games and NoPayStationV3 (NPS) is also included in one package.

# Manual Setup: #

If you wish to add them manually you will need this url: https://github.com/PS2ClassicsVault/PS2-Classics-Vault-Database/raw/main/ and after the last "/" of the url place the file name you see on this repository such as for example https://github.com/PS2ClassicsVault/PS2-Classics-Vault-Database/raw/main/ps3_games.tsv

For NoPaySation Content we already included NPS games in the ps3_games.tsv, but you will need to manually add dlcs, themes, demos and avatars to your config.txt from NoPayStation.

# Automatic Install: #

you will need to download our official PS2CV Store app for your PlayStation(R)3 system from here: https://github.com/PS2ClassicsVault/PS2-Classics-Vault-Database/releases/tag/v1.13

Then place it on your root or in a folder named "Packages" on your USB flash drive and then install it using "Package Manager" witch will be located in the Game category on your XMB menu. You can also transfter the pkg file over FTP by placing the pkg file in the following directory "dev_hdd0/packages"

This does require a PlayStation(R)3 system with either HEN or CFW installed to run.
